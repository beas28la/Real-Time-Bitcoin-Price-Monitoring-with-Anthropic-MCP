# Real-Time-Bitcoin-Price-Monitoring-with-Anthropic-MCP
- The project involves setting up a real-time data pipeline using Python and the Anthropic MCP to fetch Bitcoin price data from a robust API like CoinGecko or Bitcoin.org.
- Create a Python script using basic libraries like requests or AIOHTTP to manually pull in real-time price data every few minutes.
The script will interface with the Anthropic MCP platform to ingest data, enabling automated alerts and analytics if significant price changes surpass a pre-defined threshold.
- Implement time series analysis methods to detect price trends, using libraries like Pandas or Statsmodels.
- Visualization of the data can be achieved through Matplotlib or Plotly, providing graphical insights into price fluctuations over a specified time frame.
- The project will conclude with a report detailing the analysis process, findings, and potential real-world applications of the system.
